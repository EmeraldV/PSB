 TUTORIAL 4
DATA LINK CONTROL
1. What is the purpose of flow control? State two flow control techniques.
2. Consider a data communication link that uses a sliding window flow control with a
window size of 5 and a 3-bit sequence number (0-7). Draw the sliding window when the
sending station transmitted 5 frames (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), with acknowledgements for frames 0
and 1 received but error occurring in the acknowledgment of frame 2.
3. Consider a data communication link with 8 frames to send that uses a stop-and-wait
ARQ for error control. Draw the scenario where the sending station transmits 3 frames
(0, 1, 2), with the receiving end receiving a corrupted frame 0 and the acknowledgment
of frame 2 lost.
4. Consider the above scenario in Question 3 given that the Go-Back-N is used instead.
Assume a window size of 3.
5. Consider the above scenario in Question 3 given that the selective-reject ARQ is used
instead. Assume window size of 3.
